This is version 0.10 of the isodoc class
License: LPPL

Short description:
The isodoc class can be used for the preparation of letters,
invoices, and, in the future, similar documents. Documents are set
up with options, thus making the class easily adaptable to user’s
wishes and extensible for other document types.

standard, was the starting point.
