  This is an example of a letter made with the isodoc class. 
  It has been compiled with XeLaTeX.
  Note that the date was set to `today', so the date above the
  letter depends upon the day of compilation.

  The picture in the logo was designed by Pieter Weltevrede.
  The text in the logo is Chopin Script, the body text is MinionPro Regular.
  The text\footnote{gathered from the \TeX-distribution} has no meaning,
  its only goal is to get a long letter.
  % It's in dutch, so we select that language:
  \begin{dutch}
    \par\input{typo}
  \end{dutch}
